# Detection-of-Malicious-Url-s
I have developed a machine learning model using the Random Forest algorithm to detect malicious url's and achieved a remarkable accuracy of 92.6%. The model was trained on a dataset containing 11,055 samples and 31 features, carefully selected to capture the most relevant information for the task at hand. The Random Forest algorithm excels in handling high-dimensional data and complex relationships between features, making it an excellent choice for this dataset. The achieved accuracy demonstrates the effectiveness of the model in accurately predicting outcomes, showcasing my proficiency in machine learning techniques and my ability to deliver high-quality solutions.
